# Essential Materials for Validation
As with any process, there are materials that make the process possible and simplified. 
For validating a FOIA request, first start with downloading the FOIA data you received. This should be in the format of an excel document. If not, it is still possible to validate the data, but it may be easier to view in spreadsheet format.

Second, access TRAC's website to find the most recent data on the issue pertaining to your FOIA request. Since requests are specific, TRAC may not have the exact data gathered in your request, but they likely have something similar that will help in validation. Check on the immigration quick facts page (https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/quickfacts/) or on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) pages.
