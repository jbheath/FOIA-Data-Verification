Using the data tools offered on the TRAC website, users may be inclined to double check the data received in FOIA requests with the data that is on the TRAC website. Although TRAC has a plethora of data, it is possible that not all data will be listed. 

When it comes to where you may want to look, there are a lot of options. The first place to check concerning Department of Homeland Security data would be the Immigration Quick Facts page. https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/quickfacts/ 
This page provides an overview on statistics concerning immigration and is updated daily. 

Using the immigration tools section (https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/tools/ ) may also be of interest. In this function multiple sections appear that have data about immigration court, arrests, detention centers and more. Click on the tile that appears the most relevant to your data. Although every section is different, the tools allow for filters to be input that show results from certain time frames, locations, etc. There are various available filters that would allow for finding data relevant to what was received in FOIA report.

Although the focus is on requests from the Department of Homeland Security, TRAC offers data tools for multiple agencies.
