## The FOIA Appeals Process: What to do When Data is Incorrect

If your FOIA request is denied and you believe it does not fall under the exemptions, or anything is wrong with the data received in a request, you may consider filing an appeal to alert the agency of the issue. To file an appeal with the DHS FOIA center, write a short appeal letter stating why you wish to appeal. Then, include the original copy of the data given to you through the FOIA request or the response received. Mark your envelope in the following way:


Privacy Office, Attn: FOIA Appeals

Mail Stop 0655

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

2707 Martin Luther King Jr. AVE SE

Washington, DC 20528-06


It is important to note that agencies have different procedures for submitting appeals.
