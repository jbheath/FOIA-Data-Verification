## External Validation (Validation Level 2)
Using the data tools offered on the TRAC website, users may be inclined to double check the data received in FOIA requests with the data that is on the TRAC website. Although TRAC has a plethora of data, it is possible that not all data will be listed. 

When it comes to where you may want to look, there are a lot of options. The first place to check concerning Department of Homeland Security data would be the Immigration Quick Facts page. https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/quickfacts/ 
This page provides an overview on statistics concerning immigration and is updated daily.

The photo above shows the piece of the quick facts site that lets the user know when the data was last updated. This could be a good place to ensure the data in your file is current.

Using the immigration tools section (https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/tools/ ) may also be of interest. In this function multiple sections appear that have data about immigration court, arrests, detention centers and more. Click on the tile that appears the most relevant to your data. Although every section is different, the tools allow for filters to be input that show results from certain time frames, locations, etc. There are various available filters that would allow for finding data relevant to what was received in FOIA report.

Although the focus is on requests from the Department of Homeland Security, TRAC offers data tools for multiple agencies. 

After clicking on TRAC immigration, there should be a button which appears as a header labeled Immigration Data Tools. After clicking on this button you will come to a page like this:

![The TRAC data tools page has multiple tiles containing information about different topic within the immigration community](../Images/data%20tools.jpg)

When navigating to the above page, click on a tile that interests you or is related to your FOIA report. For example, let's say we clicked on ICE Arrests. It would lead to a page looking like this:

![A graph shows immigration arrest levels within Onondaga County, NY.](../Images/data%20tools%202.jpg)

The above graph shows the result of filters being applied to the data tools. In the state section, New York was chosen, with the county chosen being Onondaga County. The arresting agency was left at all. These filters can be altered to meet the needs of a FOIA request, ensuring that the data is reflected in both systems.
