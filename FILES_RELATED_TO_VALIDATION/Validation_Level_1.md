## Validation Level 1
To complete level 1 of validation, we need to first confirm that the data received has the most up to date information, or that the date listed on the information is plausible. For example, it is unlikely that information requested from the 1900's would have a date stamp of 2022. But, it would be plausible and prove valid if the date was around the time that the event happened. For data on ever changing topics, it is likely that a date will be recent. It is possible to validate this by looking on TRAC quick facts to find recent reports on the topic. 

There may also be a date in the file name, especially if it was released by DHS. This can be an easy way to validate that the information is recent.

Some files may be in the format of an excel file with tabs at the bottom. If available, go to the tab named footnotes to find the date for which data was extracted to be released to users. If not available, consider the data on TRAC Quick Facts and in the date stamp to determine plausability.

Using these points of information, you should be able to determine whether the current file contains up to date information. You can confirm this by comparing the underlying numbers in the Excel sheet with the numbers in TRAC's Quick Facts tool.

After verifying that the data is up to date, continue to validation level 2.
