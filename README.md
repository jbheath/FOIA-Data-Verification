# FOIA-Data-Verification
This repository will contain information for verifying data received from FOIA requests. This information would be most helpful for requests received from the Department of Homeland Security. This guide will also discuss the data tools in the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) and how those may be useful in the verification process. In addition, a glossary will describe commonly used terms in FOIA documents and how to interpret them.

## What is TRAC

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) is a research institute at Syracuse University that uses Freedom of Information Act requests and litigation to study the federal government. TRAC works to make federal government data and records more accessible for public view. Through FOIA requests, TRAC obtains data concerning several government agencies, with a concentration on immigration data. After receiving records, TRAC works to verify data and release it in formats that are easily understandable including graphs, tables, and data tools.

The purpose of this work is to give individuals a better view at how the federal government is operating. TRAC works to break down what is happening in the day-to-day function of government. For example, what new laws are being enacted? How many detainees are in the custody of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement? What threats face our country and how are agencies handling them? TRAC works to inform users of all of these and more.
